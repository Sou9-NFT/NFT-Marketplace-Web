## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.1+
- Composer
- MySQL or compatible database
- Node.js & npm (for asset building, if needed)
- Symfony CLI (recommended)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NFT-Marketplace-Web.git
   cd NFT-Marketplace-Web
   ```
2. **Install PHP dependencies:**
   ```sh
   composer install
   ```
3. **Configure environment:**
   - Copy `.env` to `.env.local` and set your database credentials:
     ```env
     DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:3306/Sou9_NFT"
     ```
4. **Run database migrations:**
   ```sh
   symfony console doctrine:database:create
   symfony console make:migration
   symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate
   ```
5. **Start the Symfony server:**
   ```sh
   symfony server:start
   # or
   symfony serve
   ```
6. **(Optional) Build assets:**
   If you modify or add frontend assets, use npm/yarn as needed.

### Useful Commands
- Clear cache:
  ```sh
  symfony console cache:clear
  ```
- See custom commands: [Commands.md](./Commands.md)

### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter `symfony.lock` or `composer.lock` errors, delete them and run `composer install` again.
- For SSL/cURL issues, set the `curl.cainfo` path in your `php.ini` to the provided `cacert.pem` file.
- If you have foreign key constraint issues, drop and recreate the database before running migrations.
